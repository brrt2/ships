### Awards

 * **2017-12-08**: we received two awards since Magda & Piotr wrote scripts allowing to clone our repo into a given folder. 

## Project ships

On-line battleships game. Guessing game for 2 players with simple GUI.

Quick facts:

* 10x10 board

* Fleet consists of: 4-mast ship, 2 3-mast ships, 3 2-mast ships and 4 1-mast ships.

* Available both in Polish and English language versions.

### Estimates

We use Milestones for estimation. GitHub is integrated with Waffle.io. With Waffle we create issues and assign them to milestones.
Milestones have realistic (default), optimistic and pessimistic (both mentioned in a milestone description) deadlines. Once a goal is achieved we close such a milestone.
We also integrated Waffle.io with our Slack channel to notify team members whenever an issue changes its status. 

### Launching 

To launch server and client programs on single machine run the below script while you are in the scripts directory.
    
    ./deployserverandclients.sh 

If you wish to play on many computers use other scripts located in scripts directory.

### Fully Supported Maven Commands 

Installation
    
    mvn clean install

Packaging

    mvn clean package

Running tests

    mvn test   

Validating Dependency Convergence

    mvn enforcer:force
    
### Site

You could either view site locally or remotely,

#### Local Site

Generate site with,

    mvn site && mvn site:stage

To view site with Firefox, while in the root folder,

    firefox target/staging/index.html 

#### Remote Site

Copy the below link to see our website on-line (keep in mind that we do not update it too often),

    https://korotkevics.github.io/ships/

## Alternative Way of Importing Testing Dependencies

On a dedicated branch it is made possible to import testing dependencies all at once from an external project.

Clone external 'testing' project,

    git clone https://github.com/korotkevics/testing; cd testing

Install 'testing' project (so it becomes available in .m2),

    mvn install

While in the 'ships' project, checkout to the dedicated branch,

    git checkout dev_sandor_extracttestingdeptodedicatedproject

Install 'ships' project (so it will use 'testing' previously installed into .m2),

    mvn install
    
No error should appear.

### Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) - Deployment

### Contributing

Every developer has his OWN developer branch. A new feature = a new dev branch. Finished feature is reviewed by other contributors. When accepted, feature should be merged to 'int' branch.
Stable release branch is 'master'. See 'Code Quality & Team Setup'.

### Non-functional Specs

    - It must work: if one cannot play, it doesn't work.
    - 60% unit test code coverage (lines).
    - Functions in accordance with functional requirements.
    - Code quality – non-OO code is tolerated in little amounts.
    - Project mantra followed (Git, Maven, test cases, etc.).
    - Java FX simple GUI
    - Network game, client-server architecture
    - Both players are human players

### Functional Specs
    
    - One game only
    - 10x10 board
    - Fleet consists of: 4-mast ship, 2 3-mast ships, 3 2-mast ships and 4 1-mast ships.
    - Winner has ships remaining while loser has none.
    - Game messages have configurable target: console (System.out, System.err) or logs or external printer.
    - We are bi-lingual: Polish and English are fine. In future we want to add more languages: messages are to be read from a file for chosen language. Choosing the language depends on configuration variable.

### Game Features

    - Drawing the boards for a player (fleet board has player's fleet and where opponent shot, "seen" board has where player fired and what he has shot).
    - Placing the fleet - diagonal placing is disallowed, only horizontal and vertical. Humans can place ships but they can also choose to randomize placement. Ships cannot touch (no adjacent field to a ship can have a ship). Ships can be partially vertical and partially horizontal, if they have the length.
    - Firing the shot - choose a place, shoot. If you hit, you repeat the shot. You can repeat as many times as you hit.
    - Hitting the ship - hit happens when place chosen has enemy ship. Mark this part of ship as hit, ask for another shot. One can repeat the shot into already hit (or even sunken) ship, but this doesn't give the right to another shot.
    - Missing the ship - misses are marked on "seen" board. One can shoot twice in the same place if it's a miss.
    - Sinking the ship - if all masts of a ship are hit, ship sinks. Once the ship has sunk, mark all adjacent fields as "missed", since none of them can have a ship anyway.
    - Sinking last ship, that is, winning.
    - Nuke - thrice per game player chooses a 3x3 area and "nukes" it, that is, all ships within take damage as if shot. This is done in addition to normal shot. Only 4-mast ship has nukes, so once they are sunk, nukes cannot be used.

### Code Quality & Team Setup

    - Holy master - everything on master is holy, this is what is being checked by customer
    - CI server - before anything gets pulled into master, it is integrated with master by CI server, it runs tests, checks, etc.
    - Reviewers - pull-requests to master that are handled by CI server are then reviewed internally by teammates
    - Outside reviewers - once team says yes, outsiders come in (each team chooses external reviewers). Two external reviewers need to say "code is OK" before it can be pulled to master.
    - Jenkins (or equivalent) is used as CI server
    - Maven is used by Jenkins and team
    - Maven has Findbugs, JaCoCo and Checkstyle integration
    - Dependency convergence must be 100%, verified with maven-enforcer plugin
    - All dependencies that are NOT newest are recorded (along with reason why) in the dependencies
    - Dependencies are newest or reason for why is in the docs, versions are kept up to date with Maven versions plugin.
    - Sonar is used to keep quality gates (just internally is fine).
    - Acceptance tests are welcome, one per feature is required
    - Documentation should be provided, explaining program architecture (diagram is necessary, CRC diagrams are most welcome)
