        Ex. DEBUG = designates fine-grained informational
        events that are most useful to debug an application.

        Levels are prioritized, so if there were more levels output would
        have been printed in the order of priority.
        The priority is:
        ALL < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < OFF.
